            <h2>Profile</h2>
            <p>I am a Design and Technology student at Parsons School of Design with a deep passion for all facets of design. My experience includes collaborating with game engineers and designers at Game Vision to create concepts, illustrations, and game assets. I also worked with a senior graphic designer at Orbus on marketing materials and branding projects. Additionally, I own a freelance business specializing in custom portraits, which has honed my skills in client relations and project management. With expertise in game and web design, I am eager to apply my creativity in a dynamic professional environment.</p>
